        16S rRNA gene compositional analysis provides a summary of the composition and structure of
        the bacterial component of the microbiome. Genomic bacterial DNA extraction methods were
        optimized to maximize the yield of bacterial DNA while keeping background amplification to a
        minimum. 16S rRNA gene sequencing methods were adapted from the methods developed for
        the Earth Microbiome Project and NIH-Human Microbiome Project. Briefly, bacterial
        genomic DNA was extracted from the total mass of the biopsied specimens using the MoBIO
        PowerLyzer Tissue and Cells DNA isolation kit and sterile spatulas for tissue transfer. The 16S
        rDNA V4 region was amplified from the extracted DNA by PCR and sequenced in the MiSeq
        platform (Illumina) using the 2x250 bp paired-end protocol yielding pair-end reads that overlap
        almost completely. The primers used for amplification contain adapters for MiSeq sequencing
        and single-index barcodes so that the PCR products may be pooled and sequenced directly,
        targeting at least 10,000 reads per sample.

        Metagenomic DNA samples were quantified by Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA
        Assay (Life Technologies) and normalized to a concentration of
        50 pg/microliter. Illumina sequencing libraries were prepared from
        100-250 pg DNA using the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation
        kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's recommended
        protocol, with reaction volumes scaled accordingly. Batches of
        24, 48, or 96 libraries were pooled by transferring equal
        volumes of each library using a Labcyte Echo 550 liquid
        handler. Insert sizes and concentrations for each pooled
        library were determined using an Agilent Bioanalyzer DNA 1000
        kit (Agilent Technologies).

        Total RNA was quantified using the Quant-iT RiboGreen RNA Assay Kit
        and normalized to 5ng/ul. Following plating, 2 uL of ERCC controls
        (using a 1:1000 dilution) were spiked into each sample.  An aliquot of
        200ng for each sample was transferred into library preparation which was
        an automated variant of the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation
        Kit.  This method preserves strand orientation of the RNA transcript. It uses
        oligo dT beads to select mRNA from the total RNA sample. It is followed by heat
        fragmentation and cDNA synthesis from the RNA template. The resultant 500bp cDNA
        then goes through library preparation (end repair, base A addition, adapter ligation,
        and enrichment) using Broad designed indexed adapters substituted in for multiplexing.
        After enrichment the libraries were quantified using Quant-iT PicoGreen (1:200 dilution).
        After normalizing samples to 5 ng/uL, the set was pooled and quantified using the KAPA
        Library Quantification Kit for Illumina Sequencing Platforms.  The entire process is in
        96-well format and all pipetting is done by either Agilent Bravo or Hamilton Starlet.

        Library construction was performed as described by Fisher et al. with some slight 
        modifications. Initial genomic DNA input into shearing was reduced from 3ug to 50ng 
        in 10uL of solution and enzymatically sheared. In addition, for adapter ligation,
        dual-indexed Illumina paired end adapters were replaced with palindromic forked 
        adapters with unique 8 base index sequences embedded within the adapter and added
        to each end.

        In-solution hybrid selection was performed using the Illumina Rapid Capture Exome 
        enrichment kit with 38Mb target erritory (29Mb baited). The targeted region includes 
        98.3% of the intervals in the Refseq exome database. Dual-indexed libraries are 
        pooled into groups of up to 96 samples prior to hybridization. The liquid handling 
        is automated on a Hamilton Starlet. The enriched library pools are quantified via 
        PicoGreen after elution from  streptavadin beads and then normalized to a range 
        compatible with sequencing template denature protocols.

        Following sample preparation, the libraries prepared using forked, indexed adapters
        were quantified using quantitative PCR (purchased from KAPA biosystems), 
        normalized to 2 nM using the Hamilton Starlet Liquid Handling system, and pooled
        by equal volume using the Hamilton Starlet Liquid Handling system. Pools were 
        then denatured using 0.1 N NaOH. Denatured samples were diluted into strip 
        tubes using the the Hamilton Starlet Liquid Handling system.

      Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) libraries were prepared as described previously
      with modifications detailed below. Briefly, genomic DNA samples were quantified using a Quant-It
      dsDNA high sensitivity kit (ThermoFisher, cat# Q33120) and normalized to a concentration of 10ng/ul. A
      total of 100ng of normalized genomic DNA was digested with MspI in a 20ul reaction containing 1ul MspI
      (20U/ul) (NEB, cat# R0106L) and 2ul of 10X CutSmart Buffer (NEB, cat# B7204S). MspI digestion
      reactions were then incubated at 37C for 2 hours followed by a 15 min. incubation at 65C.

      Next, A-tailing reactions were performed by adding 1ul dNTP mix (containing 10mM dATP, 1mM dCTP
      and 1mM dGTP) (NEB, cat# N0446S), 1ul Klenow 3'-5' exo (NEB, cat# M0212L) and 1ul 10X CutSmart
      Buffer in a total reaction volume of 30ul. A-tailing reactions were then incubated at 30C for 20 min.,
      followed by 37C for 20 min., followed by 65C for 15 min.

      Methylated Illumina sequencing adapters were then ligated to the A-tailed material (30ul) by adding
      1ul 10X CutSmart Buffer, 5ul 10mM ATP (NEB, cat# P0756S), 1ul T4 DNA Ligase (2,000,000U/ml) (NEB,
      cat# M0202M) and 2ul methylated adapters in a total reaction volume of 40ul. Adapter ligation reactions
      were then incubated at 16C overnight (16-20 hours) followed by incubation at 65C for 15 min. Adapter
      ligated material was purified using 1.2X volumes of Ampure XP according to the manufacturer’s
      recommended protocol (Beckman Coulter, cat# A63881).

      Following adapter ligation, bisulfite conversion and subsequent sample purification was performed using
      the QIAGEN EpiTect kit according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol designated for DNA
      extracted from FFPE tissues (QIAGEN, cat# 59104). Two rounds of bisulfite conversion were performed
      yielding a total of 40ul bisulfite converted DNA.

      In order to determine the minimum number of PCR cycles required for final library amplification, 50ul PCR
      reactions containing 3ul bisulfite converted DNA, 5ul 10X PfuTurbo Cx hotstart DNA polymerase buffer,
      0.5ul 100mM dNTP (25mM each dNTP) (Agilent, cat# 200415), 0.5ul Illumina TruSeq PCR primers (25uM
      each primer) and 1ul PfuTurbo Cx hotstart DNA polymerase (Agilent, cat# 600412) were prepared.
      Reactions where then split equally into four separate tubes and thermocycled using the following
      conditions - denature at 95C for 2 min. followed by 'X' cycles of 95C for 30 sec., 65C for 30 sec., 72C
      for 45 sec. (where 'X' number of cycles = 11, 13, 15 and 17), followed by a final extension at 72C for 7
      min. PCR products were purified using 1.2X volumes of Ampure XP and analyzed on an Agilent
      Bioanalyzer using a High Sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent, cat# 5067-4626). Once the optimal number of PCR
      cycles was determined, 200ul PCR reactions were prepared using 24ul bisulfite converted DNA, 20ul 10X
      PfuTurbo Cx hotstart DNA polymerase buffer, 2ul 100mM dNTPs (25mM each), 2ul Illumina TruSeq PCR
      primers (25uM each) and 4ul PfuTurbo Cx hotstart DNA polymerase with the thermal cycling conditions
      listed above. PCR reactions were purified using 1.2X volumes of Ampure XP according to the
      manufacturer's recommended protocol. Preparation of reduced representation bisulfite sequencing libraries for 
      genome-scale DNA methylation profiling analyzed on an Agilent Bioanalyzer using a High Sensitivity

        DNA was extracted via the Chemagic MSM I with the Chemagic DNA Blood Kit-96 from Perkin Elmer.
        This kit combines a chemical and mechanical lysis with magnetic bead-based purification.

        Whole Blood samples were incubated at 37C for 5-10 minutes to thaw.  The blood was then
        transferred to a deep well plate with protease and placed on the Chemagic MSM I. The following
        steps were automated on the MSM I.

        M-PVA Magnetic Beads were added to the blood, protease solution. Lysis buffer was added to the
        solution and vortexed to mix. The bead-bound DNA was then removed from solution via a
        96-rod magnetic head and washed in three Ethanol-based wash buffers to eliminate cell debris
        and protein residue. The beads were then washed in a final water wash buffer. Finally, the
        beads were dipped in elution buffer to re-suspend the DNA. The beads were then removed from solution,
        leaving purified DNA eluate.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Sera were analyzed for expression of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA),

        ELISA units (EU/mL), which are relative to laboratory standards consisting of pooled,
        antigen reactive sera from of patients with well-characterized disease.

        Our method, RNAtag-Seq, utilizes a molecular barcoding strategy
        that generates multiple libraries in a single reaction, lowers
        labor and reagent costs per sample, and produces data on
        prokaryotic and eukaryotic samples that are comparable to
        those generated by traditional strand-specific RNA-seq
        approaches.  Barcoding in RNAtag-Seq is achieved through
        direct ligation of adaptors to RNA, enabling high quality,
        strand-specific, quantitative sequencing of full-length
        transcripts in diverse prokaryotic and eukaryotic species.

        Metagenomic DNA samples were quantified by Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA
        Assay (Life Technologies) and normalized to a concentration of
        50 pg/microliter. Illumina sequencing libraries were prepared from
        100-250 pg DNA using the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation
        kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's recommended
        protocol, with reaction volumes scaled accordingly. Batches of
        24, 48, or 96 libraries were pooled by transferring equal
        volumes of each library using a Labcyte Echo 550 liquid
        handler. Insert sizes and concentrations for each pooled
        library were determined using an Agilent Bioanalyzer DNA 1000
        kit (Agilent Technologies).

        Samples were thawed on ice and then centrifuged (4C, 5,000 x g) for 5 minutes.
        Ethanol was evaporated using a gentle stream of nitrogen gas using a nitrogen evaporator (TurboVap LV;
        Biotage, Charlotte, NC) and stored at -80C until all samples in the study had been dried. Aqueous
        homogenates were generated by sonicating each sample in 900 ul of H2O using an ultrasonic probe
        homogenizer (Branson Sonifier 250) set to a duty cycle of 25% and output control of 2 for 3 minutes.
        Samples were kept on ice during the homogenization process. The homogenate for each sample was
        aliquoted into two 10 uL and two 30 uL in 1.5mL centrifuge tubes for LC-MS sample preparation and 30
        uL of homogenate from each sample were transferred into a 50 mL conical tube on ice to create a pooled
        reference sample. The pooled reference mixture was mixed by vortexing and then aliquoted (100 uL per
        aliquot) into 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes. Aliquots and reference sample aliquots were stored at -80C until
        LC-MS analyses were conducted.

        A combination of four LC-MS methods were used to profile metabolites in the fecal
        homogenates; two methods that measure polar metabolites, a method that measures metabolites of
        intermediate polarity (e.g. fatty acids and bile acids), and a lipid profiling method. For the analysis queue
        in each method, participants were randomized and longitudinal samples from each participant were
        randomized and analyzed as a group. Additionally, pairs of pooled reference samples were inserted into
        the queue at intervals of approximately 20 samples for QC and data standardization. Samples were
        prepared for each method using extraction procedures that are matched for use with the chromatography
        conditions. Data were acquired using LC-MS systems comprised of Nexera X2 U-HPLC systems
        (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments; Marlborough, MA) coupled to Q Exactive/Exactive Plus orbitrap mass
        spectrometers (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA)
